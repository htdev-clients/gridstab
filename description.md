Title: demystify grid stability and power-electronic systems

Subtitle: make complex power systems topics accessible and engaging for engineers, investorsm policy makers and energy enthusiasts

## About: 
I am an expert in power systems dynamics, stability, and control, with a special emphasis on low inertia, inverter dominated grids. I hold an M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering (2016) and earned his Ph.D. from the University of Liège (Belgium) in 2020 and performed one year Postdoc at KU Leuven (Belgium). 
My main focus areas are the study of weak grids with high penetration of converter-based generators. I am working on very technical and complex challenges linked to the massive integration of power electronic converters in the power system, from static to dynamic analysis with ElectroMagnetic Transient (EMT) simulations. This involves, among others, a study of grid-forming control and the operation and control of MultiTerminal DC (MTDC) grids.

## Services:
### Dynamic Stability Studies & Grid Modelling
I provide advanced simulations and analysis of power system dynamics, including transient stability, small-signal stability, and frequency response. I help identify vulnerabilities and optimize system performance under normal and contingency conditions.

As grids integrate more renewables and power-electronic assets, dynamic stability becomes critical to avoid blackouts and ensure reliable operation. TSOs, investors, and policymakers need accurate insights to make informed decisions on infrastructure and compliance.

### Grid Integration of Renewable & Power-Electronic Assets
Expert assessment and design of grid connection strategies for wind, solar, and HVDC systems. I support compliance with grid codes, develop control strategies, and evaluate the impact of inverter-based resources on system stability.

The energy transition hinges on seamless integration of renewables. Poorly managed connections can lead to instability and costly curtailments. My expertise ensures projects meet technical requirements and deliver maximum value.

### Advisory on Stability Compliance & Investment Risk
Strategic consulting for investors and policymakers on stability-related risks in energy projects. I provide due diligence, regulatory compliance guidance, and risk mitigation strategies for large-scale renewable and transmission investments.

Grid stability is not just a technical issue—it’s a financial and regulatory one. Understanding stability risks early prevents costly delays and ensures projects align with evolving grid codes and market expectations.
